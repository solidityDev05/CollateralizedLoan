# Collateralized Loan Contract in Solidity

This Solidity project introduces the fundamental concepts of creating, deploying, and interacting with a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Students will learn how to build a secure, functional contract that manages collateralized loans, allowing users to deposit Ethereum as collateral to request a loan, which can then be funded by lenders for interest returns.
